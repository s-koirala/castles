# Polymarket Market Maker Bot 
## Market Maker, Liquidity, Copy Trading & Automated Trading Engine

Production-ready **Polymarket trading bot** designed for **market making, liquidity provision, spread capture, and automated trading** on the Polymarket CLOB (Central Limit Order Book).

Built with **TypeScript (Node.js 20+)**, this bot helps traders and developers implement professional **algorithmic trading strategies** on Polymarket prediction markets.

---

## What this bot does

- **Real-time market making** on Polymarket CLOB (Central Limit Order Book)
- **Balanced inventory management** with mirrored YES/NO exposure control
- **Intelligent quote placement** around mid-price using spread (basis points) and orderbook data
- **Optimized cancel/replace** cycles with configurable intervals (aligned with typical taker-delay style timing)
- **Passive execution intent** — quotes are placed as limit-style orders; the design favors maker flow and avoids unnecessary crossing when configured conservatively
- **Risk management** — exposure limits, position size caps, and inventory skew checks before placing orders
- **Auto-redeem** — optional redemption of settled positions above a USD threshold (REST integration)
- **Batch operations** — optional batch cancellation to reduce API round-trips (configurable)
- **Real-time orderbook updates** via WebSocket when market discovery mode is enabled
- **Observability** — Prometheus metrics endpoint and structured JSON logs (Pino)

---

## Core features

### Inventory balance and exposure control

- **Mirrored YES/NO positioning** — Maintains balanced exposure across both sides (within configured limits)
- **Net exposure limits** — Configurable min/max exposure in USD
- **Inventory skew detection** — Risk layer checks skew before trading
- **Quote sizing** — Base size adjusted by inventory and exposure headroom
- **Target inventory balance** — Configurable neutral or biased target via `TARGET_INVENTORY_BALANCE`

### Spread farming efficiency

- **Spread-based quoting** — Mid price from best bid/ask; bid/ask derived from `MIN_SPREAD_BPS`
- **Passive-first design** — Orders are placed off mid with spread; tune size and refresh to stay passive
- **Cancel/replace cadence** — Refreshes quotes on a timer and replaces stale orders
- **Stale order cancellation** — Orders older than `ORDER_LIFETIME_MS` can be batched-cancelled

### Cancel/replace cadence

- **Configurable refresh** — `QUOTE_REFRESH_RATE_MS` (default 1000ms)
- **Taker-delay style tuning** — `TAKER_DELAY_MS` / `CANCEL_REPLACE_INTERVAL_MS` (default 500ms) for loop timing
- **Batch cancellations** — `BATCH_CANCELLATIONS` groups cancels when supported by the API path used
- **Stale order detection** — Based on order timestamps vs `ORDER_LIFETIME_MS`

### Market discovery and real-time updates

- **Discovery mode** — When enabled, loads active markets and resolves your configured `MARKET_ID`
- **Direct mode** — When discovery is off, loads market metadata for `MARKET_ID` via REST
- **WebSocket orderbook** — Subscribes to L2-style updates for the active market when discovery is enabled
- **REST fallbacks** — Orderbook and market info via HTTP when needed

`DISCOVERY_WINDOW_MINUTES` is available in config for future or external tooling; the core loop keys off `MARKET_ID` and active market lists.

### Risk management

- **Exposure limits** — Hard caps via `MAX_EXPOSURE_USD` / `MIN_EXPOSURE_USD`
- **Position size limits** — `MAX_POSITION_SIZE_USD` per validation pass
- **Inventory skew limits** — `INVENTORY_SKEW_LIMIT`
- **Stop-loss** — `STOP_LOSS_PCT` present in config (extend strategy logic if you need it enforced end-to-end)
- **Pre-trade validation** — `RiskManager` validates before each quote

### Auto-redeem and gas-related settings

- **Automatic redemption** — Polls redeemable positions and redeems above `REDEEM_THRESHOLD_USD` when enabled
- **Gas-oriented flags** — `GAS_BATCHING_ENABLED`, `GAS_PRICE_GWEI` in config for workflows that use on-chain operations alongside trading
- **Efficient cancel paths** — Prefer batch cancel when `BATCH_CANCELLATIONS=true`

### Performance monitoring

- **Prometheus** — HTTP `/metrics` (default port 9305)
- **Structured JSON logging** — Pino; suitable for aggregation and audit trails
- **Metric series** — Orders, inventory, exposure, spread, profit, quote latency (see below)

## Quick start

### 1) Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+**
- **npm** (or compatible client)
- Polygon-funded wallet and Polymarket `PRIVATE_KEY` / `MARKET_ID`

### 2) Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ConteurShadow/Polymarket-Market-Maker-Bot.git
cd Polymarket-Market-Maker-Bot
npm install
npm run build
```

### 3) Configure `.env`

```bash
copy .env.example .env
```

Minimum:

```env
PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
MARKET_ID=0xYOUR_MARKET_ID
```

`.env.example` also includes recommended defaults for size, spread, risk, and timing. You can keep them for a first run, then tune.

### 4) Run

```bash
npm start
```

Development (TypeScript directly):

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## Common setup errors

- **Invalid CONFIG at startup** — `.env` missing or required keys unset; fix `PRIVATE_KEY` and `MARKET_ID` first.
- **No quotes** — Confirm the market is active, `MARKET_ID` is correct, and REST returns a sensible orderbook (`best_bid` / `best_ask`).
- **WebSocket issues** — Check `POLYMARKET_WS_URL` and network/firewall rules.

---

## Safety notes

- Start with small `DEFAULT_SIZE` and tight exposure caps.
- Never commit real private keys.
- Paper-test logic and logs before scaling size.

---

## Parameter tuning guide

### Inventory balance

- **MAX_EXPOSURE_USD / MIN_EXPOSURE_USD** — Set from capital and risk tolerance; smaller = tighter control.
- **INVENTORY_SKEW_LIMIT** — e.g. `0.3` ≈ 30% max skew before risk rejects (tune to your style).
- **TARGET_INVENTORY_BALANCE** — `0` neutral; positive/negative for directional bias in sizing behavior.

### Spread farming

- **MIN_SPREAD_BPS** — Minimum spread width (10 bps = 0.1%).
- **QUOTE_STEP_BPS** — Step size between levels (reserved for extensions).
- **DEFAULT_SIZE** — Base notional; scale with depth and liquidity.

### Cancel/replace timing

- **CANCEL_REPLACE_INTERVAL_MS** — Loop sleep between refresh passes (default 500ms).
- **QUOTE_REFRESH_RATE_MS** — Minimum time between quote refreshes (default 1000ms).
- **ORDER_LIFETIME_MS** — Stale order age before cancel (default 3000ms).

### Performance-oriented flags

- **BATCH_CANCELLATIONS** — `true` to prefer batch cancel endpoint when applicable.
- **AUTO_REDEEM_ENABLED** — `true` to run periodic redeem passes.
- **GAS_BATCHING_ENABLED** — For strategies combining on-chain ops with API trading.

## Monitoring and observability

### Prometheus metrics

Scrape URL (default): `http://localhost:9305/metrics`

Key series (names may vary slightly by version; inspect `/metrics`):

- `pm_mm_orders_placed_total` — Orders placed (labels: side, outcome)
- `pm_mm_orders_filled_total` — Fills (when wired to your feed)
- `pm_mm_inventory` — Inventory gauges
- `pm_mm_exposure_usd` — Net exposure
- `pm_mm_spread_bps` — Spread
- `pm_mm_profit_usd` — Profit tracker
- `pm_mm_quote_latency_ms` — Latency histogram

### Structured logging

Logs are JSON (Pino). Typical topics: quotes placed/cancelled, risk rejections, websocket lifecycle, auto-redeem.

Example shape:

```json
{
  "level": 30,
  "msg": "quote_placed",
  "outcome": "YES",
  "side": "BUY",
  "price": 0.65,
  "size": 100,
  "order_id": "0x..."
}
```

## Performance benchmarks (indicative)

Targets depend on network, API limits, and market. Order-of-magnitude expectations often discussed for similar bots:

| Metric | Typical target range |
|--------|----------------------|
| Quote refresh | Sub-100ms locally; end-to-end includes API RTT |
| Cancel/replace cycle | ~500–1000ms (configurable) |
| WebSocket RTT | Highly network-dependent |
| Inventory skew | Below your `INVENTORY_SKEW_LIMIT` |

Treat these as goals, not guarantees.

## Who this is for

People searching for: Polymarket market maker bot, Polymarket trading bot, CLOB market making, Polymarket automated trading, prediction market liquidity tools.

Suited to: professional market makers, systematic traders, and builders who want a **TypeScript** codebase they can extend (multi-market, dynamic spreads, ML sizing, portfolio risk, etc.).

---

## Risk management best practices

1. Start small: low `DEFAULT_SIZE` and conservative exposure caps.
2. Monitor inventory and skew continuously.
3. Set exposure limits that match worst-case moves.
4. Validate on small notional before scaling.
5. Watch gas and API rate limits if you add on-chain workflows.
6. Read logs for risk rejections and connectivity issues.

---

## Common issues and troubleshooting

### Orders not filling

- Spread too wide or too narrow vs the book — tune `MIN_SPREAD_BPS`.
- Confirm REST orderbook and websocket (if used) show consistent top of book.
- Queue position: you may be behind larger makers.

### High inventory skew

- Tighten `MAX_EXPOSURE_USD` / `MIN_EXPOSURE_USD`.
- Lower size or increase skew sensitivity via config and logic.

### Excessive costs or API load

- Increase `QUOTE_REFRESH_RATE_MS` / `CANCEL_REPLACE_INTERVAL_MS`.
- Use `BATCH_CANCELLATIONS=true` where supported.

### WebSocket disconnections

- Client reconnects with backoff; check stability of `POLYMARKET_WS_URL` and local network.

## Future enhancements

- Multi-market quoting
- Dynamic spread from volatility or orderbook pressure
- ML-assisted sizing
- Portfolio-level risk across markets
- Deeper fill and position sync from user channel / trades feed
